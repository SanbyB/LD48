### Idea

* Game like minecraft where you going deeper into world and get materials to craft weapons and kill more things
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_Dug
    * Killing one resource and getting one entity
    * Limit and horizontal and vertical 
    * Clicking for attacking / physical attack
    * Aiming with mouse and kill creatures
    * The score is the number of ore you can get
    * Upgradeable sword or trade ore for better weapons
        * Starts off with basic sword
        * Upgrade to different equipment

-------------

* As you go deeper it gets darker
* Cookie clicker type mine corporation
* Ball dropping game endless scroller
* Cluedo and dig deeper to figure out who was the murderer
* submarine kind of game
    * Internal view of a submarine
    * Maintain the systems of submarine before it implodes
* Nuclear fallout shelter theme
    * Have different things that would kill someone and different systems
